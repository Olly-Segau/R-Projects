# Sample Superstore Analysis in R <br/>
The focus is to answer the following business questions: 
- How do Sales impact Profit in the context of the data available? 
- Is there a statistically significant linear relationship between Sales and Profit?

**Key take away**
1. A positive correlation coefficient of 0.58176 suggests that as Sales increases, Profit tends to increase as well, and vice versa. However, the magnitude of the correlation coefficient (0.58176) indicates that the relationship is not perfect and there may be other factors influencing the relationship between Sales and Profit.
2. The estimated coefficient for Sales (0.1942) suggests that, on average, for every one-unit increase in Sales, Profit is expected to increase by 0.1942 units, assuming all other variables are held constant.
3. It is observed that the highest recorded sales occurred in 2009, and there has not been a similar level in subsequent years observed. This suggests a potential decline in sales performance over the years, which could be further investigated and analyzed to identify any underlying factors or trends impacting sales dynamics.
